The code in this repository provides [OpenCMIS](http://chemistry.apache.org/java/opencmis.html) based CMIS support for [Grails](http://www.grails.org/).

This is intended to become an official Grails plugin - watch out for a forthcoming article in [GroovyMag](http://wwww.groovymag.com) and coverage on <http://leanjavaengineering.wordpress.com>.
